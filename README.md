# ildaBlueToothObjective-C
bluetooth support for Chinese galvo RGB controllers (in theory, the real protocol needs to be reverse-engineered but this is like the stubs for the interface)

PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, the lead developer is basically learning about Bluetooth packet sniffing in order to figure this out, if you have any links that relate to RGB galvo animation lasers the Bluetooth connects as a serial port via on Mac OS. Specifically the source, but if you're trying to sell your stuff maybe I'll add the link. I'm basically just missing the knowledge on the bluetooth protocol Light Elf uses.
